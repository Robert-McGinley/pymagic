A python module to simulate the unix file command.

Largely inspired/taken/copied from the honeynet magic.py
except this attempts to use the non-mime descriptions of data
and to use at least the level 0 magic descriptions from the linux file
command's Magdir repository of file matches. 

The hope is to have a python module that can be reasonably used
on windows since python-magic and libmagic seem to be out of 
support on windows.
