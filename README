A python module to simulate the unix file command.

Largely inspired/taken/copied from the honeynet magic.py
except this attempts to use the non-mime descriptions of data
and to use at least the level 0 magic descriptions from the linux file
command's Magdir repository of file matches. 

The hope is to have a python module that can be reasonably used
on windows since python-magic and libmagic seem to be out of 
support on windows.


Usage: 
./magic.py somefile.mp3
somefile.mp3: MPEG ADTS layer III, v1

BUGS: 
Doesn't use any level beyond level 0 of the file hits, so it will determine /usr/bin/less is ELF, 
but not ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.9, stripped
